    <p>
        I recently finished working on blackjack.py: a stylish blackjack game that you can play in your browser but
        should
        instead clone the repo and play it locally. The performance is bad in the browser and doesn't do justice to the
        game.
    </p>
    <p>
        I could blame the performance on Pygame, the library I used to build it. Or I could blame it on pygbag, the web
        assembly compiler that produced the index.html and blackjack.apk files. Or I could blame it on my own code,
        maybe
        it could have been optimised better. All of these options are tempting but I will instead blame my own
        designer's
        myopia.
    </p>

    <p>
        I enjoyed making the original terminal based version of the game: it was an optional assignment for a Python
        object-oriented programming class. At this point, what I got out of the project was learning, and was mostly
        satisfied.
        However, there is a certain something lacking from playing any game that's just text-based, so I decided I would
        make
        a GUI.
    </p>

    <p>
        Choosing Pygame was my first mistake. For a variety of reasons, but most importantly: I didn't acknowledge or
        even
        think about what I wanted to get out of this project, I just took a decision on a whim.
    </p>

    <p>
        If I had spent any amount of time thinking about what I wanted: a compact little browser game to share around
        and
        highlight some of the OOP principles I had learned, I would have ruled out Pygame immediately. Javascript is
        perfectly suited to OOP, especially for game design, and there are plenty of graphical libraries to make my life
        easy: p5.js comes to mind. But most importantly, it's the perfect choice for browser-based distribution.
    </p>

    <p>
        There would have been a little bit of work recreating the program in Javascript, and then adding the graphical
        elements, but then it would have worked.
    </p>

    <p>
        Instead, I wrote the entire thing in Pygame, tried to figure out how to get it onto the browser, learned about
        pygbag, troubleshooted pygbag, realised that I hadn't structured my game loop with pygbag in mind, refactored
        the Pygame code, troubleshooting again, got it to compile correctly and the result is something I'm not
        satisfied
        with.
    </p>

    <p>
        At quite a few steps along the way, with respect to my own time and achieving a desirable outcome, I ought to
        have
        bailed on the Pygame endeavour and tried something else. Or, at least, even thought about what I wanted out of
        it.

    </p>

    <p>
        You can play it here, and I still think you should even if it's a bit slow. I have some desire to do the game
        justice and make it in something like p5.js, but I think it serves better as a lesson.
    </p>

    <p>
        Think about what you want to get out, it'll let you know what you need to put in.
