        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
            I'm Eoin, I live in Dublin and I'm nearing the end of an MSc in Computer Science at 
            UCD. I have a background in business, finance, production and presentation coaching, but am most
            excited by a future in software engineering.
        </p>

        <p>
            I enjoy big projects and getting to work on every part of the stack. Most recently I've been exposed
            to the DevOps side of things as the maintenance lead for my latest college project. You should
            definitely check out some of projects to see what I've been getting into, or take a look at my:

            <p>
                Pinbox is shareable map platform designed to let users share their favourite places in Manhattan,
                and to give tourists and locals alike an interactive way to discover new places and plan their visit.
            </p>
            <p>
                Utilising the Google Places API to gather info about bars, restaraunts, museums and more, and official
                statistics about taxi and subway stations, we implemented a time series analysis to predict whether or
                not the new space you just <em>have</em> to visit will be jam-packed or dead quiet when you get there.
            </p>
            <p>
                Users swipe through a recommonedation feed based on where they drop their own pin, and theses attitudes 
                populate your Pinbox and your map.

            <p><em>Gemvironmentally Friendly</em> was a group project for a Java programming: we were asked to make
                a game themed around sustainable transport.</p>
            <p>Our little man runs, bikes or drives around the screen collecting gems because why <em>wouldn't</em>
                you want to collect gems?</p>
            <p>You're slower on foot or on bike, but your carbon footprint is smaller; you're faster in cars and
                public transport but you'll produce more emmissions.</p>
            <p>I had a lot of fun with this project: A* Star pathfinding, external and internal collisions (trust
                me, the internal collision were far trickier) and and UI and gameloop integration.</p>
            <p>There are some finicky things about getting a game developed in Java to run in the browser, and
                it may be rough around the edges you can play it <a href="/gems">here!</a></p>

                <h2>Dublin Bikes Live</h2>
            </a>
            <p>This app does a whole lot in a small package: a single page Flask app with some minimal APIs plugged into
                an ML pipeline.
            </p>
            <p>You can get realtime information for every Dublin Bike rental station in the city, historic occupancy trends,
                hourly predictions for the next 12 hours and a map of the city with the stations colour coded by occupancy.
            </p>
            <p>
                This project was a lot of fun to work on because the tasks were so diverse: debugging JS in the morning,
                working on the ML pipeline in the afternoon and then getting to grips with how the endpoints stitch it all 
                together until later in the evening than I'd care to admit.

            </a>
            <p>
                Before I got back to college I tried this simple React project to ease
                myself back into programming.
            </p>
            <p>
                There's an was interesting book, <a
                    href="https://books.google.ie/books/about/The_Loom_of_Language.html?id=g24XKBDPOYcC&redir_esc=y">The
                    Loom of Language</a>,
                written in the 40s about the merits of learning many languages of the same family at ths same time.
            </p>
            <p>
                The logic being that it's not much more effort to learn vocabulary of multiple
                languages that share the same etymological roots: I made an small app to
                quiz you on food in the romance languages.
